                <p class="section-paragraph">Often times we hear people source this data, performing <strong>data aggregation</strong> and <strong>data science</strong>.  For example, how popular have muffins been lately around the web?  Are muffins more popular around the globe today than they were last year?  These questions can be answered by you now, with SocioSearch.  Is Seattle more popular than San Francisco?  Are Mochas more popular than Green Tea specifically in Seattle?  There is an infinite ocean of data, and an infinite ocean of questions you can now answer using SocioSearch.</p>
